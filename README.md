# Scholar-Scraper
This is some code to help scrape article titles, URLs, abstracts, and other pertinent information from Google Scholar search results.

## To Use
Add your search terms to the search_term list on line 153. Once those are in, you can run the code to get your results. 

## Future additions
It would be nice to have the data formatted in different ways, or have the option to change the filetype of the results.
